# BOLD Coupling

The output of the neuron population simulation is then passed through a second model that
combines and transforms the neuronal signal into a BOLD response. We used a modified version
of the Balloon-Windkessel model, a biophysical model which considers the viscoelastic properties
of blood vessels formulated by Havlicek et al. as follows [22].
